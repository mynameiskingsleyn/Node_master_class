Node JS
Lesson 1(Introduction)
	Table of content. —> CLI, API,
Lesson 2 (Prerequisites)

Lesson 3(Setting up Workstation)
Lesson 4(The story of NodeJs)
	Take from this is that node is not really being used as pure node rather the packages that run around it is being used
Lesson 6 ( what is Node)
	 It is a C++ application that embeds the v8 js engine.
	Now represents itself as a two application
		1. A script processor
			node {script name}
				event loop.
			node js is single thread…

		2. A REPL(Read Evaluate Print Loop)
======================================================================
Lesson 7 (Anatomy of a Node Application)

Lesson 8 (Common Node convention)
	package.json ==> “dependencies”
	Testing and task running
		Normally inside a test directory, normally triggered by  a “test runner” such as Mocha.
			( if project is using CI  or Deployment CD ) and using a CI CD runner such as Travis CI, you will notice a ‘.travis.yml’ file included in the root
			directory. Which tells travis CI all the configuration that the project needs for the Test to pass as well as the settings.
			Similary, if the project is using a Javascript Linter such as javascript hint, you will notice another hidden file  a ‘.jshintrc’ file, which tells the
			linter the configuration.
		General-purpose task runners often control the whole process.
		Two most popular are Grunt and Gulp.
	Node configuration
		start you app with
		NODE_ENV=myEnvironmentName node index.js
	Styles and patterns
		most popular is published by airbnb ==> https://github.com/airbnb/javascript
		linters( jshint and jslint) will catch the styling issues. also inform the syntax many devs use.

	Error Handling
		common approach 3 approach
		1. error back.
		2. we avoid throwing exceptions, rather we return error to the caller. throwing an exception will kill the entire application since it is a single
			threaded.
		3. Avoid Globals. So you can avoid namespace collisions with any libraries we maybe using.

Lesson 9 (Node Js vs the browser)
	in the browser you have a lot of functions that are available to you that are not in node

	window.open							document
	window.location						document.body
	window.navigator						onchange
	window.origin							onclick
	window.focus							onblure
	window.blur							oncopy
	window.scroll							uncut
	window.alert							onscroll
	window.localstorage					onmouseenter
	window.onload						onmouseleave

There are no backend equivalent to this in backend.

Node is one environment, the browser is many (cross browser issues in browser)

section 3 Lesson 10(Section over view)
	Requirement
		1. A restful Api listen on a PORT and accepts incoming HTTP request for POST, GET, PUT, DELETE and HEAD
		2. The Api should allow a client to connect then create a new user, then edit and delete that user.
		3. We want users to be able to sign in, which gives them a token that they can use for subsequent authenticated requests.
		4. The API to allow the user to “sign out” which invalidates their token.
		5. The API to allow a signed-in user to use their token to create a new “check” ( a task for the system to check a url for up and down)
		6. The API allows a signed-in user to edit or delete any of their checks. and limit their checks to 5.
		7. In the background, workers perform all the “checks” at the appropriate times, and send alerts to the users when a check changes its state from
			“up” to “down”, or vise versa.
		        checkes to run ones a minute.
	Note, we would use the Twilio api to send SMS..
	We are not going to use a third party library to connect to twilio, we would be crafting it by hand.
	This app, we will be using a filesystem as a key-value store of json docs. In a real app, you’d want a DB.
Lesson 11 (Basic Scaffolding)
	just creating folder and adding index.js

Lesson 12 (Starting a Server)
	very simple, we use the http library

Lesson 13 (Parsing request path)
	library ==> url
	we do ==> var parsedUrl = url.parse(req.url,true)
			var path = parsedUrl.pathname;
			var trimmedPath = path.replace(/^\/+|\/+$/g,'');
	Note ==> clear == cntrl + k
	curl ==> curl localhost:4000/foo .

lesson 14 (parsing HTTP method)

lesson 15 (Parson the Query string)
	var queryStringObject = parsedUrl.query;
Lesson  16( Parsing Headers)
	var headers = req.headers
Lesson 17( Parsing Payloads)
	StringDecoder = require(‘string_decoder’).StringDecoder;
	var decoder = new StringDecoder(‘utf-8’)
	Payload comes as a stream, so we will need to catch it by binding to an event that the request object emits. (DATA)
	req.on(‘data’, function(data) {
		buffer += decoder.write(data);
	}
	Another event that tells us that the stream is ended is called ‘end’
Lesson 18(Routing the request)
	Set status code -> res.writeHead(statusCode);
	var payloadString = JSON.stringify(payload);
	res.end(payloadString);

Lesson 19(Returning Json)
	to force the return to look like JSON we have to set the header
	—> res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');

Lesson 20(Adding Configuration)
 	We create a config.js file, here we define the configurations we need via environments object
	var environments = {}; environments.staging = {‘var’: value },
	var currentEnv = typeof(process.env.NODE_ENV) note that —> NODE_ENV is passed to the terminal.
	now in terminal —> NODE_ENV=production node index.js
Lesson 21(Adding Https support)
	We will need to create ssl certification.
Lesson 22(Service 1 /ping)
Lesson 23(Storing data)
	note —> path is used to normalize the path to different directories

Lesson 24(Service 2 :/users)
	adding the handler.js in the lib.
Lesson 25(service 3: /tokens

Lesson 27(Connecting to an API)
	we try not to use another persons library to integrate by crafting ours.
Lesson 28(Background workers)

Lesson 29(Logging to file)
	Working with log files.
	conpressing file library ==> zlib.
Lesson 30(Logging to the )
	Utilities package ==> var util = require('util');
					    var debug = util.debuglog('workers');
	Then start ==> NODE_DEBUG=workers node index.js (without this all debugs in file will not work)
		in our file we switch “console.log” with “debug” except for the colorings!!
		console log colors
			console.log('\x1b[36m%s\x1b[0m', 'I am cyan');  //cyan
			console.log('\x1b[33m%s\x1b[0m', stringToMakeYellow);  //yellow
		color reference
			Reset = "\x1b[0m"
			Bright = "\x1b[1m"
			Dim = "\x1b[2m"
			Underscore = "\x1b[4m"
			Blink = "\x1b[5m"
			Reverse = "\x1b[7m"
			Hidden = "\x1b[8m"

			FgBlack = "\x1b[30m"
			FgRed = "\x1b[31m"
			FgGreen = "\x1b[32m"
			FgYellow = "\x1b[33m"
			FgBlue = "\x1b[34m"
			FgMagenta = "\x1b[35m"
			FgCyan = "\x1b[36m"
			FgWhite = "\x1b[37m"
			FgGray = "\x1b[90m"

			BgBlack = "\x1b[40m"
			BgRed = "\x1b[41m"
			BgGreen = "\x1b[42m"
			BgYellow = "\x1b[43m"
			BgBlue = "\x1b[44m"
			BgMagenta = "\x1b[45m"
			BgCyan = "\x1b[46m"
			BgWhite = "\x1b[47m"
			BgGray = "\x1b[100m"
Lesson 31(Section Review)
Section 4 Lesson 32(Section overview)
Lesson 33(Refactoring for a GUI)
 	modified server.js and handler.js
	setting up the read using path and fs to read template files in template directory.
Lesson 34(Using templates)
	We implement interpolation by using a find an replace.
Lesson 35 (Serving Static Assets)
	added more functions and edited handler to in crude public handler and so
Lesson 36(Making AJAX Request)
	modify to crack http request without jQuery or any library.

Lesson 46(Section Review)

Section 5(Lesson 47)(Section overview)
	Command Line tool. We will be using an Event-driven design pattern
		Anytime a user puts something on the console, it will emit event which will trigger one or more function.
		The application is going to be responding to a number of requests.
			“exit” , “man”/“help”, “stats”, “list users”,
			“more user info —{userId}”
			“list checks”, “list checks —up”, “list checks —down”
			“more check info —{checkId}” , “list log"

Lesson 48(Adding CLI)
	for interacting with the command line, we used readline which takes some input object to create an interface
	var readline = require(‘readline’)
	var _interface = readline.createInterface({
    					input: process.stdin,
    					output: process.stdout,
    					prompt: ''
 				  });
	this is not the only way. We can also use REPL .
Lesson 49(Handling Events)
	Build handlers and responders
Lesson 50(Command 1: Exit)
	we just use ==> process.exit(0). -> process is a global function.
Lesson 51(Command Man)
	Just create an object with all the available commands as key and value = description.
	Using process.stdout.colum (to get screen size) we were able to format the help properly..

Lesson 52(Command 3: Stats)
	mostly utilized the Vb and so to get info
Lesson 53(Command 4: List Users)
Lesson 54(Command 5: More User Info)
	Here we used the console.dir.
Lesson 55(Command 6: List checks)
Lesson 56(Command 7: More check Info)

TESTING FOR !!!!!
Section 6-Lesson 60(Section overview)
	Gaining Stability.
	Using test debugger.
	How to create, use and catch errors.
	Advanced use of the debugger.
	Using “strict” flag to lint your code. (light weight version of linting code)
	Adding a test runner, unit tests, and integration tests.

Lesson 61(Crating Errors and handling it)
	using a user specifying error
Lesson 62(Using the debugger)
	to run your application with debugger ==> node inspect index.js
	we add breaking points by simply adding (debugger)
	e.g
		// Start the server
  			debugger;
 			server.init();
  			debugger;
	 Now, this will create breaking points on everywhere it sees ‘debugger’
	Now you can use commands
		cont==> continue execution
		next==> to step to the next breaking point.
		in/out => to step in or out
		pause=> to pause it.
		repl ==> allow you to see the values of your variables
			just type the name of the variable you want to see.
Lesson 63(Linting with ‘strict’)
	using ‘strict’ mode will only catch a certain subset of issues.
		such as
			declaring global properties, trying to delete undeletable properties
			silently failing properties.

	To utilize this, run application with ==> node —use_strict index.js
	when we don’t use strict, some of this errors get ignored but they might end up crashing your app.
	using strict will flag this errors.
Lesson 64(Adding a test runner)

Lesson 65 (Adding unit tests)
	Pushing the test to their own files
